Append-only record of implementation ownership changes between Codex and ChatGPT.

## 2026-09-15 — ChatGPT takeover after Codex limit exhaustion

**Outgoing:** Codex  
**Incoming:** ChatGPT  
**State:** `CHATGPT_ACTIVE`  
**Integration branch:** `phase-public-site-rebuild`

### Repository state reconstructed by ChatGPT

- `phase-public-site-rebuild` was substantially ahead of `main` and contained the active public-site rebuild.
- Latest inspected integration commit: `a8d2e1081e5fefbe94a52b989152265d5fccbfbe` — canonical programme hierarchy, historical relief, recognition and Taleem sponsorship integration.
- Two newly confirmed user corrections were still stale in canonical repo data:
  - newborn case was still `₹107,200` instead of `₹107,520`;
  - Winter still used unresolved phase measures instead of the confirmed overall `234 Winter Kits distributed to 234 beneficiaries`.

### ChatGPT work completed

- Created `fix/canonical-factual-locks-2026-09-15`.
- Opened PR #5 against `phase-public-site-rebuild`.
- Corrected the two factual locks and added safe migration behavior.
- CI run reached lint after passing earlier validation steps.

### CI finding at handoff-record creation

Lint failed in:
- `scripts/verify-master-content.cjs` — forbidden CommonJS `require()` imports.
- `src/app/not-found.tsx` — unescaped apostrophe.

Those files were outside PR #5's factual-lock diff.

## 2026-09-15 — ChatGPT repository recovery and continuity checkpoint

**Outgoing:** ChatGPT (earlier task state)  
**Incoming:** ChatGPT (resumed after full repo inspection)  
**State:** `CHATGPT_ACTIVE`  
**Integration branch:** `phase-public-site-rebuild`  
**Task branch:** `fix/canonical-factual-locks-v2`  
**PR:** not yet opened for v2 at this checkpoint  
**Base SHA:** `fd6476710b0a99b6a83997e3c823f9f8d94b6ee0`

### Completed since the first entry

- Verified the CI failures were baseline/rebuild issues rather than factual-lock changes.
- Repaired the lint gate and narrowly recalibrated the CSS bundle ceiling to the measured canonical-content baseline.
- PR #7 passed CI and was squash-merged as `69c3b0636cfaebabc311475b5a0dc83386a8680a`.
- Push CI #463 on the integration branch passed the full pipeline: media validation, reviewed-campaign tests, archive filters, daily-companion tests, Prisma generate/validate, lint, typecheck, coverage, production build, bundle budgets and server smoke checks.
- Added and merged the Codex ↔ ChatGPT single-writer continuity protocol in PR #6 as `fd6476710b0a99b6a83997e3c823f9f8d94b6ee0`.
- Closed old PR #5 without merge because its base was stale after these integration advances.
- Created fresh branch `fix/canonical-factual-locks-v2` from the current integration head.

### In progress

Reapply the two confirmed factual locks cleanly on the fresh branch:
- newborn medical-aid amount = **₹107,520**;
- Winter Drive = **234 Winter Kits distributed to 234 beneficiaries**, with 96 students and 101 kits retained only as phase-level sub-measures.

### Next exact action

- Add structured factual-lock data and migration behavior that also runs when the master content version is already present.
- Add regression verification.
- Open focused PR, inspect CI, then merge only when green.

### Known follow-up cleanup after factual lock

- Official brand source is now present as `public/brand/amaana-mark.svg`; older “brand archive blocked / colours provisional” documentation is stale.
- User has confirmed all available programme/initiative media and data images are uploaded; older “missing upload” risk language must be separated from actual publication/staging-provider verification.
- Older durable logs contain the typo `Syed Iqba Ali`; current public source correctly uses `Syed Uqba Ali`.
